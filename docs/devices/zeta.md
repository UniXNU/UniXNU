# Microsoft Surface Duo 2 (zeta)

| Repository | Maintainer | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [UniXNU-zeta](https://github.com/none24smu/UniXNU-zeta) | [none24smu](https://github.com/none24smu) | UEFI, menu and payload volume work; kernel step blocked |

## State

| Step | State |
| --- | --- |
| UEFI firmware | boots on the phone with `fastboot boot`; UniXNU menu on the panel, volume and power keys work, the boot image ramdisk mounts as the payload volume |
| Device repository | this repository |
| IPSW identity | iPhone18,2 26.5.2 23F84 |
| ADT | zeta hardware values with the iPhone18,2 identity from the IPSW device tree |
| Payload and boot image | blocked on the kernel: the kernel step targets xnu-10063 (iOS 17), while 23F84 uses xnu-12377 |
| Root and userland | not started |

The firmware half is [uefi-zeta](https://github.com/none24smu/uefi-zeta), a Mu-Silicium tree with `Platforms/Microsoft/zetaPkg`.

## Maintenance

The maintainer owns the repository and its release decisions. UniXNU documentation lists the port and its state; it does not take over maintenance.
