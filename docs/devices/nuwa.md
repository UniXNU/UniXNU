# Xiaomi 13 Pro (nuwa)

nuwa is the Xiaomi 13 Pro with the SM8550 SoC and 12 GB of RAM. The port below is an independent community project. The UniXNU organization does not maintain it. The target is iOS 16 with the iPhone10,3 / d22ap identity.

| Repository | Maintainer | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [UniXNU-nuwa](https://github.com/wh1stl3/UniXNU-nuwa) | [wh1stl3](https://github.com/wh1stl3) | Source kernel builds and links; platform archives, prelink and hardware not done |

## State

| Layer | State |
| --- | --- |
| Source kernel | xnu 8796.141.3 builds and links in CI; ARM64 `MH_EXECUTE`, Darwin 22.6.0, no unresolved symbols |
| Platform archives | not passing; `ArmCpu` includes and the Darwin 22 archive build are still in progress |
| Donor interface | 65,348 pointer bindings checked; the source kernel misses the APFS `_vfs_getvfs_with_vfsops` binding |
| VFS bridge | static checks pass; the actual compile is pending |
| Prelink, QEMU and hardware | not run |
| Board file | `example = true`; firmware `uefi-nuwa` and the nuwa platform values are not established |

`docs/STATUS.md` in the repository is the current source of truth.

## Maintenance

The maintainer owns the repository and its release decisions. UniXNU documentation lists the port and its state; it does not take over maintenance.
