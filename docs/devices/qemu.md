# QEMU virt

The QEMU target runs UniXNU on the AArch64 `virt` machine. It substitutes for a tablet during bring-up. The port below is an independent community project. The UniXNU organization does not maintain it.

| Repository | Maintainer | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [UniXNU-qemu](https://github.com/xVanTuring/UniXNU-qemu) | [xVanTuring](https://github.com/xVanTuring) | iPadOS 17 home screen and Settings; Metal on the Mac GPU with `--metal` |
| [UniXNU-qemu](https://github.com/yyx2025/UniXNU-qemu) | [yyx2025](https://github.com/yyx2025) | QEMU virt repository used for vermeer bring-up |

## State

| Stage | State |
| --- | --- |
| UniXNU menu, configuration, DarwinBoot as a driver | works |
| DarwinBoot handoff, 4 GiB window, kernel entry, MMU and 4 KiB page tables | works |
| Platform expert and IOKit | works |
| Verified VirtIO root | works; owner-signed root mounted |
| AMFI and original launchd | start with the original trust cache |
| SystemOS union and dyld shared cache | work |
| Data ramdisk | works |
| Display | NativeLegacyDisplay on ramfb; CPU-rendered without `--metal`, and composed on the Mac's GPU with `--metal` |
| Touch and Home | work; typing not yet |
| GPU | QemuMetal device; `--metal` runs the render server's Metal work on the Mac's GPU. Without it there is no Metal device and QuartzCore uses the CPU renderer |
| Settings | without `--metal` it stays white; with it the app opens and lists everything, with some row icons missing |

`--metal` needs the plugin, owner trust cache and Data seed built by `scripts/build-qemu-metal.py`. The repository README records the commands that stage the ESP and boot QEMU.

## Maintenance

The maintainer owns the repository and its release decisions. UniXNU documentation lists the port and its state; it does not take over maintenance.
