# GopFramebuffer

Start with the [adaptation procedure](/porting/display) for board inputs, source changes, build integration and verification order.

Framebuffer presentation using the firmware GOP handoff.

[Source repository](https://github.com/UniXNU/GopFramebuffer).

The implementation reads the firmware framebuffer through PE_current_console and integrates with the selected MobileFramebuffer ABI. Board hooks supply display policy and GPU scanout integration.

## Integration

The catalog records implementation scope, hardware and OS requirements, board dependencies, revision, build stage, outputs, and runtime identifiers. The selected profile orders build commands by dependency.

```sh
./unixnu build kernel -D ../UniXNU-sheng
```

[Component catalog](/reference/components)

Frame diagnostics record explicit GPU/display links and completed raw pixel samples. See [GPU frame diagnostics](/porting/gpu-diagnostics).
